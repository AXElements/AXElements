  # @note Technically, this method allows you to set multiple attributes
  #       on a single object with a single call; but this behaviour is
  #       likely to change in the future to only allow setting one attribute
  #       per call.
  # @todo In order to support the ideal syntax, I will have to alter
  #       Element#method_missing to return a triple (self, attr, value)
  #       in the case when an extra argument is passed.
  #
  # The syntax kinda sucks, and you would think that the #set method should
  # belong to AX::Element, but I think taking it out of the class helps make
  # the abstraction more concrete.

  #   set scroll_bar, value: 10
  # @example How I would like it to work eventually
  #   set scroll_bar.value 10
