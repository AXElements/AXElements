    # @todo add another app launching method using app names
    #
    # This is the standard way of creating an application object. It will
    # launch the app if it is not already running and then create the
    # accessibility object.
    #
    # However, this method is a HUGE hack in cases where the app is not
    # already running; I've tried to register for notifications, launch
    # synchronously, etc., but there is always a problem with accessibility
    # not being ready. Hopefully this problem will go away on Lion...
