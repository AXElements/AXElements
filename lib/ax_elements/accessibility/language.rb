# methods from this module.

  # @group Actions

  ##
  # We assume that any method that has the first argument with a type
  # of {AX::Element} is intended to be an action and so `#method_missing`
  # will forward the message to the element.

  # @note We try to set focus to the element first; this is to avoid false
  #       positives where developers assumed an element would have to have
  #       focus before a user could change the value.
  #
  # You would think that the #set method should belong to {AX::Element},
  # but I think taking it out of the class and putting it in front helps
  # make the difference between performing actions and inspecting UI more
  # concrete.

  # to the point given by calling `#to_point` on the argument.
