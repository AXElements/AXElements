# Mouse Events

@todo This might go away once the acting tutorial is done

Generally not needed, as built in AX actions will be sufficient. However, there
is a module that will allow an object to be clicked.

It is important to note that all AXAPI methods, as well as the {Mouse}
module, use the flipped coordinate system for looking at points. That
is, the origin (0, 0) is located in the top left of the screen.
