Notifications
=============

Notifications are a tool that you can use to add a delay in script
that waits until a certain event happens, such as waiting for a web
page to load.

You can find a list of built in notifications in Apple's [documentation](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Accessibility/Reference/AccessibilityLowlevel/AXNotificationConstants_h/index.html).
